#### Data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surviellance System (BRFSS) was analyzed to study the current asthma prevalence and risk factors of asthma among Michigan adult population.  
The current asthma prevalence was calculated to be 11.2%.  
In the univariate analysis, asthma was found to be significantly associated with the various demographic, socio-economic and health-related predictors under study.  In the final model, female sex, age-group (18-24), below high school education, income in the $15,000-25,000 range, inability to work, obesity (BMIâ‰¥3000), borderline diabetes and presence of COPD were identified as the potential risk factors of asthma.
